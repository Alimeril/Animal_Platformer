A simple platformer game in Python arcade library.

Arcade is a newer Python 2D game engine compared to its classic counterpart, pygame. While it may not have pygame's flexibility and compatibility with nearly every platform, it does offer many built-in features that make game development much easier and more entertaining. Additionally, it comes with better graphics and improved Sprite management.

The primary element of the arcade game engine is the arcade.Window class. This class is responsible for creating the game window and includes built-in functions for handling events, such as clicking, dragging, pressing a key on the keyboard, and updating the screen.
